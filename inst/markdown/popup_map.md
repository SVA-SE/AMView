The outputs of this page (the map and the pie charts) can be controlled by
the user through various filters. These filters consist of several different
dropdown menus, as well as a timeline slider below the map view. The default
view, where nothing is selected in the filter dropdowns and the whole time range
is included, means that no filters are applied and all available data are shown.
This is functionally equivalent to selecting every option in every dropdown.

The map summarizes the total amount of AMU per every region represented in the
underlying data, within the given timeperiod and under constraint of the applied
filters. The pie charts instead show the distribution per animal type, diagnosis
and medication group, respectively, and are affected by filters in the same way
as the map.

There are also three buttons on this page. Apart from the "About this page"
button (which you have clicked to view this text), there are two download
options:

* "Save map as PNG" saves the current map view, as-is, to a PNG file.
"As-is" also includes purely visual aspects such as the current level of zoom.

* "Download current map data" saves the current underlying map data to a CSV
file. The data is grouped per region and all current filters are applied.
