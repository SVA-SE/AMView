# About

This dashboard is an RShiny application that visualizes antimicrobial use (AMU) data in animals. The app
is a work in progress under the [DigiVet](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jenright/digivet_website/) project.
The final version will be uploaded to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/digivet?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest).

 For this showcase of the dashboard, we have generated artificial data whose characteristics are based on official AMU statistics from the Swedish cattle sector. The data format follows a common AMU data structure, which has been developed within the DigiVet project. An instruction and template for the common data structure can be downloaded by clicking the button below.
