## How to navigate this page

This page has one output: the trends graph. This can be controlled by various
inputs, here listed top to bottom, left to right:

* Date range (timeslider)
    * Controls the time period visible in the chart.
* Chart type (drop down)
    * Controls how to visually draw the chart.
* X axis unit (radio button)
    * Controls which unit is displayed on the x axis.
* Group by (radio button)
    * Controls which category to group the data by (or "none"). The groups are
    shown to the right of the chart and can be included or excluded
    from the view independently.
* Filters (dropdowns)
    * Constrain the data that is displayed in the chart similarly to the date
    range timeslider. The default (nothing selected) means that no filter is
    applied and that all available data are included.

There are also three buttons on this page. Apart from the "About this page"
button (which you have clicked to view this text), there are two download
options:

* "Save plot as PNG" saves the current plot view, as-is, to a PNG file.
"As-is" also includes purely visual aspects such as the current level of zoom
and which groups are currently (de)selected.

* "Download current data selection" saves the current underlying plot data to a
CSV file, with all aggregation and filter selections applied.
